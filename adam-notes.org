*** nuclear waste
- spent fuel rods go into what sounds like is essentially a swimming
  pool (with thick lining) to cool
- then they put in welded steel cylinders and just sit around ("dry casks")
  - designed to be interim, but no long term permanent storage
    facility anywhere in the world.
    - is that possible?
    - and if it was what does that mean philosphically?
- algae remediation?

**** Katy Barnhart Projections of Landscape Evolution on a 10,000 Year Timescale With Assessment and Partitioning of Uncertainty Sources
- waste from a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility
- tiny change in initial condition leads to big change in model results
- so if you dig a culvert somewhere, or put a road in, can completely
  change the landscape and whether you have nuclear waste exposed or not.

- dive into more
  - was effluent federally legal
  - if so, what is the justification, and what harm would it have done
    (+ uncertainty)?
  - if harm, what policy tool can be used to make this illegal at the
    federal level?

** find existing request for proposal to redesign or provide waste management

** design dog poop system for NYC people will actually use
- keep dog poop out of landfills
- eliminate plastic bag usage
- if people actually use it less dog poop everywhere

** occidental chemical corporation in Tacoma
- https://ecology.wa.gov/Spills-Cleanup/Contamination-cleanup/Cleanup-sites/Occidental-Chemical-Co
** experimental waste reduction (applied)
- different interventions to different folks, record results
- what are the systemic bariers you come across.
** compost
*** building scale compost system
- use bins a la underground center
- then use soil to build out tree wells and rain gardens, possibly in
  street parking.
- can also use soils for rooftop urban farms
- pipe water through bins for warm water (capacity? see underground
  center).
- synergistic with cloud burst projects; reduce runoff.
- pest protection?

*** new roots farm project idea
- problem: on site compost is labor intensive, and more importantly,
  does not get hot enough to be "comercial grade", so it can not
  process invasives. Invasives end up in landfill.
- Also, Cheryl could come up with a ton of other waste management

*** shagbark farm community compost

** mixing of organics and hazards vs separation
- related: "dilution is the solution" vs "isolate the hazardous stuff and
  handle it"
** small scale systems and adaptability
- push for zero waste; we are in times of change and uncertainty
- so maybe similiar reasoning as in James's water/climate paper applies to waste:
  - https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001154
- sequential small (time) scale projects
- what about space scale?
- correlation between time and space scale

** brownfields development
- seen a ton of calls for work for this in NYS procurement

** akhil's projects
*** waste to energy
**** bioreactor company
- when he bought this company was thinkig they would build 12
  reactors/year, but haven't been able to build a single one because
  of technical challenges. basically sounds like it is much harder and
  more technical than they were expecting
***** dairy waste
- anaerobic digestor/bioreactor; produces methane and biosolids. carbon
  accounting is carbon negative because carbon comes in from the
  atmosphere and gets fixed in the biosolids, but I'm skeptical of
  some of the assumptions they likely had to make to reach "negative"
***** aerobic compost projection
- aerobic bioreacotir/digestor. takes in high organic stuff, releases
  co2 and heat, get compost product out
- ppl are thinking down the line carbon capture, but akhil seemed
  skeptical that will wok

**** covanta
***** plant in dublin
- akhil's take was that it all burns and goes into the air; not too
  much pollution control
***** plant in newark
- has contacts for possible site visit
*** canadian waste management company
- picks up municiple waste at transfer station and landfills it
- also does port-a-john?
* Resources
** superfund site lookup (thanks Elizabeth!)
- https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live
- Like most industries at the time, Occidental disposed of their waste
  in ways that were completely legal before state and federal laws
  were in effect. They released chemicals into the Hylebos waterway
  and Commencement Bay or put it in unlined settling ponds or ships.

- Now, under the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)
  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) there is a legal
  framework for the proper management and disposal of hazardous waste.

* Waste management
** waste and energy
-NYSERDA trying to locate energy infrastructure on former landfill
 and/or brownfields sites:  https://www.nyscr.ny.gov/business/adsPubView.cfm?ID=4C9D16F2-866E-4D72-B89D-B74D41F509CA&page=Open%20Ad
** compost
- large scale, municple: "Anaerobic Digestion facility
  where source-separated food wastes from large generators
  (institutions, food processors) are treated to produce methane
  and a compost product."
- does this keep us reliant on fossil fuel infrastructure, or is it
  repurposing it for something better?
** landfills
*** and compost
- what is the role of Alternate Daily Cover and how much of it comes
  from municple compost?
** a fundamental question: what is the value of organic matter in different Earth system (and waste management) contexts?!?
- seems like everybody wants C$_x$ H$_x$ type stuff.
** solid waste definition
- "Solid wastes are the undesirable and worthless solids which are generated from
  municipal, industrial, and agricultural activities" from
  [[docview:~/Documents/mycoremediation_env_sustainability.pdf::1][~/Documents/mycoremediation_env_sustainability.pdf]]

** incineration and/or waste to energy
*** waste to energy
**** can I get materials from 4210 THERMAL TREATMNT-WASTE/BIO MAT?
**** small scale waste to energy?
- e.g., building scale. used to burn trash locally, too much pollution
  and bad idea. but w/ modern emissions control is it possible to
  design a local plant or reactor? what are the economies of scale?
  (can scale in mass manufacturing compensate for scale in
  plant/incinerator size?)
- is this more adaptable as we go to zero waste? does it better
  incentivize transition to zero waste? is it more just?
**** how much is waste to energy dependent on composition of the waste input (organics fraction)?
- is there a risk if we divert all our organics w2e companies will
  start buying biomass to make their system work? consequences for
  Earth system?
- more generally, how much do different waste to energy systems "lock
  us in" to different waste generation (and consumption) patterns?
- pg 71 in Module 1 of thanos's slides seems to suggest C6H10O4 is
  necessary (or representative) of waste input. Is this true with max
  diversion?
**** organic waste to energy?
- https://mailchi.mp/b1143dc5dcbc/2023yearinreview-20301453
**** covanta hemstead violations ash management
- https://dec.ny.gov/news/press-releases/2024/2/dec-review-of-historic-ash-management-practices-finds-violations-at-covanta-hempstead-resource-recovery-facility
- what is the difference in  pollutant profile between bottom and fly ash?
- why is this a big deal? (or is it?)

**** gasification
- partial oxidation, limit O2, create fuel
**** general notes
- reduce mass of waste, but ash can be highly concentrated (relative
  to input) w/ heavy metals
**** group 2 mentioned carbon capture: brilliant
- evokes BECCS (all time bad engineering solution), but this
  application seems good and intriguing because it is trash not trees.
