** Nuclear
*** nuclear waste
- spent fuel rods go into what sounds like is essentially a swimming
  pool (with thick lining) to cool
- then they put in welded steel cylinders and just sit around ("dry casks")
  - designed to be interim, but no long term permanent storage
    facility anywhere in the world.
- algae remediation?
- nice summary of radioactive waste:

**** Katy Barnhart Projections of Landscape Evolution on a 10,000 Year Timescale With Assessment and Partitioning of Uncertainty Sources
- waste from a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility
- tiny change in initial condition leads to big change in model results
- so if you dig a culvert somewhere, or put a road in, can completely
  change the landscape and whether you have nuclear waste exposed or not.
