*** nuclear waste
- spent fuel rods go into what sounds like is essentially a swimming
  pool (with thick lining) to cool
- then they put in welded steel cylinders and just sit around ("dry casks")
  - designed to be interim, but no long term permanent storage
    facility anywhere in the world.
    - is that possible?
    - and if it was what does that mean philosphically?
- algae remediation?

- so if you dig a culvert somewhere, or put a road in, can completely
  change the landscape and whether you have nuclear waste exposed or not.

    (+ uncertainty)?

** find existing request for proposal to redesign or provide waste management

** design dog poop system for NYC people will actually use
- keep dog poop out of landfills
- eliminate plastic bag usage
- if people actually use it less dog poop everywhere

** occidental chemical corporation in Tacoma

** experimental waste reduction (applied)
- different interventions to different folks, record results
- what are the systemic bariers you come across.
** building scale compost system
- use bins a la underground center
- then use soil to build out tree wells and rain gardens, possibly in
  street parking.
- can also use soils for rooftop urban farms
- pipe water through bins for warm water (capacity? see underground
  center).
- synergistic with cloud burst projects; reduce runoff.
- pest protection?

** mixing of organics and hazards vs separation
- related: "dilution is the solution" vs "isolate the hazardous stuff and
  handle it"
** small scale systems and adaptability
- push for zero waste; we are in times of change and uncertainty
- so maybe similiar reasoning as in James's water/climate paper applies to waste:
  - https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001154
- sequential small (time) scale projects
- what about space scale?
- correlation between time and space scale
* Resources
** superfund site lookup (thanks Elizabeth!)
- https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live
- Like most industries at the time, Occidental disposed of their waste
  in ways that were completely legal before state and federal laws
  were in effect. They released chemicals into the Hylebos waterway
  and Commencement Bay or put it in unlined settling ponds or ships.

- Now, under the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)
  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) there is a legal
  framework for the proper management and disposal of hazardous waste.

* Waste management
** solid waste definition
- "Solid wastes are the undesirable and worthless solids which are generated from
  municipal, industrial, and agricultural activities" from
  [[docview:~/Documents/mycoremediation_env_sustainability.pdf::1][~/Documents/mycoremediation_env_sustainability.pdf]]

** incineration
- reduce mass of waste, but ash can be highly concentrated (relative
  to input) w/ heavy metals
