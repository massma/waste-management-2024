* Solid and Hazardous Waste Management

** Introduction
- I'm Adam (he/him)

- Got my doctorate at CU in 2022; work focused on ecosystem response
  to aridity; pre-CU past includes work on snow hydrology, mountain
  weather, and lake effect snowstorms.

- Since 2018 I've worked as a environmental consultant with [[https://ketawaters.com/][Keta
  Waters]]; most of my work is on river systems in the Pacific Northwest
  of the US.

- I also enjoy dancing, running, walking, baking & cooking, and reading.

** What do I bring to this course?
- I am not a leading expert on Solid and Hazardous Waste.

- I am a relatively experienced scientific researcher in diverse
  domains.

- I am a relatively experienced engineering problem solver in diverse
  domains.

- I've participated in and facilitated programming on education in
  higher ed. I care a lot about learning.


** Goals for today
The goal is to introduce:

1. The learning objective for the course.

2. The learning community approach to this course.

3. How we will use group projects to achieve the learning objective.

4. Introduce the class website, and tentative plan for the next couple
   of weeks.
** The Learning Objective

Collectively design solid/hazardous waste-related interventions that
improve the health of the Earth system.

** Learning Community Approach
- We are a community working together to achieve our learning objective.

- Think of me as a facilitator to help the collective towards that
  learning objective.

- [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4BuOWJOin1FxwsyJ0vJAVV42QEq9WeRSfVbQaDdsxA/edit?usp=sharing][Community agreement]]

** ...How, specifically, will we meet the learning objective?

- "Collectively design solid/hazardous waste-related interventions that
   improve the health of the Earth system."

- We will do exactly the learning objective in group projects, and
  learn by doing (active learning).

- Our first task is to get into groups (4-6 people)!

- (we will do more thorough class introductions, etc. through our
  groups)

** [[https://massma.github.io/waste-management-2024/][The Website]]

- [[https://massma.github.io/waste-management-2024/][This]] is where all updates will be pushed, and is the place to check
  for what's going on.

- It is also editable through github; but you can also just email me
  any edits you want.

** Solid and hazardous waste warm up activity

- Think about how you would define "waste". And what about the "solid"
  and/or "hazardous" parts?

** Solid and hazardous waste warm up activity
- Think about how you would define "waste". And what about the "solid"
  and/or "hazardous" parts?
- How would your answer change if you were an aerobic bacteria,
  earthworm, or fungi?

** Solid and hazardous waste warm up activity #2
- If you were not allowed to dispose of any solid waste (for example,
  you had to keep it in your dorm room or apartment, forever) how
  would you life choices change?
** Solid and hazardous waste warm up activity #2
- If you were not allowed to dispose of any solid waste (e.g., you had
  to keep it in your dorm room or apartment, forever) how would your
  life choices change?
- Why did I ask you to do this thought experiment?

** Thank you!!!

- Think about project ideas, and be ready to discuss on Thursday.

- If you haven't already, please record a name pronunciation on Courseworks.
