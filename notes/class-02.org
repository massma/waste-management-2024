* Solid and Hazardous Waste Management (#2)

** Mindfulness
** Any thoughts or questions?
** Where we're at
** Elizabeth's introduction and slides
** Learning objectives
1. Define solid waste.
2. Define hazardous waste.
3. Identify and define the solid and/or hazardous waste streams in
   different project areas.
4. Generate exploratory intervention ideas related to different
   project areas.
** Review from Tuesday

- Is everybody feeling okay with the collective feedback and grading
  plan?

** Review from Tuesday: interventions have consequences

- Everything is interconnected.

- The interventions we make and solutions we design impact behavior
  and decision making.

- We should consider the potential consequences of our
  designs/interventions/actions.

** Review from Tuesday: some initial definitions of waste

- Definition of waste as "stuff we can no longer use."
  - "we" can be different people/systems/ecosystems/etc.
  - nice solutions connect one "we's" waste with another "we's"
    food/resource/etc..

- What about the "solid" part?

- What about the "hazardous" part?

** Somewhat related to definitions: how do project topics fit in with EEE curriculum?

- Goal is to work on projects and learn material you might not be able
  to learn elsewhere in the EEE curriculum.
  - EAEE 4210 THERMAL TREATMNT-WASTE/BIO MAT
  - EAEE E4150 AIR POLLUTION PREVENTION/CONTR
  - EAEE E4951 Engineering systems for water treatment and re-use.
  - EACE E4163 Sustainable Water Treatment and Reuse.
  - EAEE E4950 ENIVRON BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES

** Group activity

- Introduce yourselves (names and pronouns)
  - Share your project ideas, topics, and/or questions and confusion

- Discuss your project idea/topics (starting with one), using your
  group's collab doc linked on the website as a guide:

  1. What are the waste(s) you are working with?
  2. Are the waste(s) solid? And/or under what conditions are
     they solid?
  3. Are the waste(s) hazardous? And/or under what conditions are they
     hazardous? To what/whom are they hazardous?
  4. Are there any other systems that could use the waste(s)? What
     processes/transformations would improve utilization?
  5. What are some possible interventions or culminating deliverables
     for this project?

- Do you want to dive right in or have me demo this first?

** Next activities: choose our own adventure
- Flip through notes on project ideas

- Research approach ([[https://scholar.google.com/][google scholar]], [[https://clio.columbia.edu/][CLIO]], [[https://www-webofscience-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/wos/woscc/basic-search][web of science]], [[https://www.nypl.org/][nypl]])

- Take time to fill out survey

- Return to Groups for more project discussion

- Return to Groups for image hunt

** Did we meet our learning objectives?

** For Tuesday (September 10th)

- *Important*: if you have not already, fill out the survey by tonight.

- Expect an email from me Friday or Saturday introducing your groups.

- Read through your group-mates' responses and re-think about project
  ideas for Tuesday's discussion.
