** Mindfulness
** Anything to bring forward?
** Elizabeth introduction
** Learning objective
** Review from Tuesday

- Is everybody feeling okay with the collective feedback and grading
  plan?

** Review from Tuesday

- Definition of waste as "stuff we can no longer use."
  - "we" can be different people/systems/ecosystems/etc.
  - great solutions connect one "we's" waste with another "we's" food.

- What about the "solid" part?

- What about the "hazardous" part?

** Review from Tuesday cont'd

- Everything is interconnected.

- The interventions we make and solutions we design impact behavior
  and decision making.

- We should consider the potential consequences of our
  designs/interventions/actions.

- Conversely, past decisions, policy and design limit our
  interventions. Who made those past decisions? Who is making the
  current decisions?

** Group activity

- Introduce yourselves

- Share your project ideas or topics

- For each project idea/topic try and define:

  1. The waste(s) you are working with (and from what perspectives/systems)?
  2. Are there any other perspectives/systems that could use the
     waste?
  3. Are the waste(s) solid? Or under what conditions is it solid?
  4. Are the waste(s) hazardous? Or under what conditions is it
     hazardous? To what is it hazardous?
  5. What are some possible interventions?

** Mushroom Idea

1. from humans: wood, compost, ash-contaminated soils, pig slurry, probably
   more.
2. Yes, a lot of this organic material can be used in other things;
   but the fungi help break down toxic compounds, and help generate
   soil/hummus that is ready to be used by plants faster.
3. So far mostly solid
4. Some of the ash applications seem pretty hazardous, and sounds like
   mushrooms can help with treated wood that has bad chemicals in
   it. Mushrooms also release enzymes that help break a lot of stuff
   down; also can encourage growth of other organisms that break stuff
   down.
5. Add mushrooms to different compost bins, encourage mushrooms to
   grow in old dumps/landfills, etc.

   - can also explore cicular manufacturing with mycelium-based composites.


** Dog poop Idea

1. Dog poop (in cities)
2. Yes; soils! Bacteria, funghi, all the "soils makers" etc., and then
   from there plants can use it.
3. Hopefully solid but not always.
4. To my knowledge not hazarous to most things in most circumstances,
   but can be if it has pathogens (need to research this more)
    - Need to research this more
5. What are some possible interventions?
   - Public reusable scoops and buckets?
   - Policy requiring individual (city-provided) scoops/buckets.
   - How do we make this something people will actually use?
   - What are the costs of making this a separate waste stream?
   - How can it be woven in with other existing (or emerging waste
     streams) like compost?


** Flip through notes

** Research approach (google scholar, clio, web of science, nypl)

** Return to Groups and discuss more
