** Mindfulness
** Any thouths or questions?
** Elizabeth introduction and slides
** Learning objective
1. Define solid waste.
2. Define hazardous waste.
3. Identify and define the solid and/or hazardous waste streams in our
   project areas.
4. Generate exploratory intervention ideas related to our project
   areas.
** Review from Tuesday

- Is everybody feeling okay with the collective feedback and grading
  plan?

** Review from Tuesday: interventions have consequences

- Everything is interconnected.

- The interventions we make and solutions we design impact behavior
  and decision making.

- We should consider the potential consequences of our
  designs/interventions/actions.

** Review from Tuesday: some intitial definitons of waste

- Definition of waste as "stuff we can no longer use."
  - "we" can be different people/systems/ecosystems/etc.
  - great solutions connect one "we's" waste with another "we's" food.

- What about the "solid" part?

- What about the "hazardous" part?


** Last thoughts on definitions and project topics
- Goal is to work on projects and learn material you can't learn
  elsewhere in the EEE curriculm.
  - EAEE 4210 THERMAL TREATMNT-WASTE/BIO MAT
  - EAEE E4150 AIR POLLUTION PREVENTION/CONTR
  - EAEE E4951 Engineering systems for water treatment and re-use.
  - EACE E4163 Sustainable Water Treatment and Reuse.
  - EAEE E4950 ENIVRON BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSES

** Group activity

- Introduce yourselves (names and pronouns)
  - Share your project ideas or topics

- For each project idea/topic try and define:

  1. What are the waste(s) you are working with?
  2. Are the waste(s) solid? And/or under what conditions are
     they solid?
  3. Are the waste(s) hazardous? And/or under what conditions are they
     hazardous? To what/whom are they hazardous?
  4. Utilization: Are there any other perspectives/systems that could
     use the waste(s)? What processes/transformations would improve
     utilization?
  5. What are some possible interventions or culminating deliverables
     for this project?


** Mushroom Idea

1. Wood, compost, ash and pesticide contaminated soils, pig slurry,
   probably more.
2. So far mostly solid
3. Some of the ash and pesticide applications seem pretty hazardous to
   earth ecosystems (including humans), and sounds like mushrooms can
   help with treated wood that has bad chemicals in it as
   well. Mushrooms release enzymes that help break a lot of stuff
   down; also can encourage growth of other organisms that break stuff
   down.
4. Yes, a lot of this organic material can be used in other things;
   but the fungi help break down toxic compounds, and help generate
   soil/hummus that is ready to be used by plants faster.
5. Design: Add mushrooms to different compost bins, encourage mushrooms to
   grow in old dumps/landfills, etc.

   Design: Can also explore circular manufacturing with mycelium-based
   composites.

   Data tool/decision making: interactive quantification or
   visualization of how much fungi can boost remediation and reduce
   time to some healthy soil metric (or other ecosystem measure), as a
   function of waste and fungi type (maybe environmental conditions as
   well).

** Dog poop Idea

1. Dog poop (in nyc)
2. Hopefully solid but not always.
3. To my knowledge not hazarous to most things in most circumstances,
   but can be bio-hazardous. Also dogs are capable of eating hazardous
   stuff...
   - Need to look into this more
5. Yes; soils! Bacteria, funghi, all the "soils makers" etc., and then
   from there plants can use it.
4. What are some possible interventions?
   - Design: Public reusable scoops and buckets?
   - Design: Policy requiring individual (city-provided) scoops/buckets.
   - How do we make this something people will actually use?
   - What are the costs of making this a separate waste stream?
   - How can it be woven in with other existing (or emerging waste
     streams) like compost?
   - Design: micro compost bins in each tree well, with public scoop
   - Design: redesign tree wells themselves for sanitary and
     hands-free composting of poop. (some kind of multilayered system
     or automated top soils mixer or something?)
