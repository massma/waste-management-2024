* Solid and Hazardous Waste Management (#6) [Please sit with your project group]
** Mindfulness

** Group Introduction: Goals

- Introduce everybody and hear everybody's voice!

- Introduce your topic idea (or problems you are having picking a
  topic, so we can help problem solve).

** For next Thursday: find a case study
- There is a collaborative Case Study doc in your folder that explains
  the activity and has space for group work.

- I also included an example I am currently working on in the course
  drive folder.

- There will be time in Tuesday's class to work on this.
