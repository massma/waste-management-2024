* Solid and Hazardous Waste Management (#6) [Please sit with your project group]
** Mindfulness

** Group Introduction: Goals

- Introduce everybody and hear everybody's voice!

- Introduce your topic idea (or problems you are having picking a
  topic, so we can help problem solve).

** For next Thursday: find a case study
- A case study is a specific example of an intervention or designed
  system in your project area. My recommendation would be to find
  something with narrow scope and/or local (e.g., Covanta plant for
  waste to energy [or a small scale compost example?]; DSNY Battery
  Recycling).

- While you go through the case study make a list of questions you had
  (don't need to answer them now, they are for further inquiry). For
  example
  - Why did they do X?
  - What does X word mean?
  - What is the hazardous threshold of X substance?
  - Where does X material end up?
  - Where does X material come from?

- Make a note of what worked well (or is working well) in the design

- Make a note of any challenges that they had

  - These challenges could be opportunities for an intervention
