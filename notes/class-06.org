** For next Thursday: find a case study
- A case study is a specific example of an intervention or desinged
  system in your project area. My recomendation would be to find
  something local (e.g., Covanta plant for waste to energy; DSNY
  Battery Recycling).

- While you go through it make a list of questions you had (don't need
  to answer them now, they are for further inquiry). For example
  - Why did they do X?
  - What does X word mean?
  - What is the hazardous threhsold of X substance?
  - Where does X material end up?
  - Where does X material come from?

- Make a note of what worked well (or is working well) in the design

- Make a note of any challenges that they had
