** Thursday's share out reflection

- Purposes of share outs:
  1. Help problem solve any group issues or issues with the project.
  2. Share information/learn about other waste management facets not
     covered by our groups' project.
  3. Collective accountability: maintain progress on projects so we
     can achieve our goals (learning + *impact*).

- Can share outs be improved?

- Specificity helps

- Can be anything to do with class time, groups, out of class
  activities and research, the website, etc.
  - Survey is anonymous

- Focus on learning, not necessarily comfort and ease

** Thursday's class

- Review survey and feedback; discussion

- Discuss early project themes, dependencies, and tensions?

- Group work?

- Share outs?
