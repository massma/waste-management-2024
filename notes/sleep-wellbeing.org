** Health and Wellbeing: sleep and food
- Most of all I care about you as humans, but wellness also
  matters for engineering

- Prioritize sleep
  - Sleep impacts ability and performance (including engineering problem solving)

  - Screens, caffeine, and alcohol (especially drinks before bed)
    harm sleep

- Prioritize eating well
  - If access to food is a challenge for you, please let me know
